Custom Resolution Utility

Use "CVT-RB2 standard" as template

Front porch:
 - Horizontal: 1 pixels
 - Vertical: 1 lines (2+ for non-gaming monitor)

Sync width:
 - Horizontal: CVT-RB2 Default
 - Vertical: CVT-RB2 Default

Back porch:
 + MORE SENSITIVE THAN FRONT PORCH, REQUIRES GAMING MONITOR FOR LOW VALUES
 - Horizontal: 1 pixels (25+ non-gaming monitor)
 - Vertical: 1 lines (6 DEFAULT for non-gaming monitor)


Screen will wobble and shake when values are too low, or not work at all (Frequency out of range / No signal)

Screen tearing will be more noticeable when using lower values for "Front porch" and "Back porch" using low refresh rates

Lower resolutions or higher refresh rates dont allow for lower values

When "Out of frequency range" or "No signal" occurs on reboot, go into SAFE MODE (F11 during reboot then F8) and revert back to "CVT-RB2 standard" template and lowest value possible without glitching
