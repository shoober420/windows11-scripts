AMD Adrenalin Program (C:\Program Files\AMD\CNext\CNext\RadeonSoftware.exe)

You cannot be in the Windows Insider program if you're on a local account, requires Microsoft account sign-in

Be careful with driver updater programs. Some programs (IObit Driver Booster) download bad / questionable drivers that can break components (like keyboard and mouse).
   +++ NEVER install drivers that driver updater programs find. use them as reference and look them up, then download yourself if legit

You need to reinstall video drivers, reconfigure video settings, and disable services again after new insider build updates (use bat script)

Remember to update the NICID for these registry settings when using a new NIC card
 - HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{NICID}\TcpAckFrequency 1

Basic Troubleshooting
 - DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
 - dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup (cleans WinSxS directory)
 - sfc /scannow
 - chkdsk c: /sdcleanup /offlinescanandfix
 - chkdsk c: /f /r /x /b

Reinstall deleted Windows Store Apps
 - launch enablestore.bat script
 - open run
 - ms-windows-store:

Reinstall Settings app
 - enable ClipSVC
 - run and cmd
 - powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\ImmersiveControlPanel\AppxManifest.xml

Reinstall all Windows apps
 - enable ClipSVC
 - run and cmd
 - Get-AppXPackage | foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

Re-enter product key
 - open cmd
 - wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey
 - copy product key
 - open run
 - ms-settings:activation
 - change product key
 - paste product key
 +++ OPTIONAL clear product key (backup product key before executing)
      - slmgr /upk
      - slmgr /cpky

Run windows update
 - open powershell terminal
 - Install-Module PSWindowsUpdate
 - Get-WindowsUpdate
 - Install-WindowsUpdate

A newer build is available in windows update, but still says "You're up to date"
 - download latest build iso (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso)
 - mount and run setup.exe
 - select "Keep Windows settings, personal files, and apps" option

Some latest insider canary builds may break systems with certain hardware (like Asus motherboards and Asus laptops for example), and not get pushed to the machine. do some research on the insider canary build if it's available but not getting pushed to the system before forcing an iso update to the machine

Run DISM / SFC / chkdsk through WinRE
 - boot into WinRE and open cmdprompt
 - run diskpart then "list volume"
 - find the drive letter corresponding to Windows (Label: OS)
 - make sure to note boot partition drive letter (Label: System)
 - exit diskpart
 - sfc /scannow /offbootdir=C:\ /offwindir=C:\windows
 - DISM /image:C:\ /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
 - chkdsk c: /sdcleanup /offlinescanandfix
 - chkdsk c: /f /r /x /b

Access C:\ from WinRE
 - cmdprompt and diskpart
 - "list vol" and find drive letter corresponding to "Label: OS"
 - exit diskpart
 - cd command doesn't work in X:\* directories
 - type C: (not C:\)
 - cd command now works once inside drive C:
 - Desktop directory is either in "C:\Users\"username"\Desktop" or "C:\Users\"username"\OneDrive\Desktop"

 - "cd" changes directories and lists current working directory
 - "dir" list files in a directory
 - "del" removes files from system
 - "move" moves files into another directory
 - "ren" renames files

explorer.exe - System warning ! Unknown Hard error
 - enable services with bat scripts
 - Run DISM / SFC / chkdsk through WinRE
 - Refresh this PC
 - LAST RESORT! WinRE - Reset this PC

Black screen after login
 - CTRL+ALT+DEL to open Task Manager
 - click "Run new task" to open Run

Powershell can't be used in WinRE by default

Feedback-Hub gives 0x80190001 error when signing in
 - Make sure you sign into the feedback-hub using your Microsoft account before applying bat tweaks, or you'll have to wait until next build release for settings to default again to sign in successfully (feedback hub works after tweaks are applied)

Error 192 - AMD Software installer Cannot Continue Due to an Operating System Issue
 - install latest NVIDIA driver
 - execute all enable*.bat scripts

Error 195 - AMD Software Installer Cannot Continue Because It Is Unable to Access the Required Web Resources
 - install drivers manually not using auto-detect web installer

Update certification has expired. Make sure your date, time, and time zone settings are correct and we'll try to install the update later
 - set date and time to period when update was first issued
 - run windows update again
 - change back date and time to current

Windows is still setting up the class configuration for this device. (Code 56)
 - make sure "Network Setup Service (NetSetupDvc)" service is enabled
 - reinstall drivers
 - try another wireless device
 - try wired connection
 - ResetNetwork.bat (WARNING!!! resets network settings)
 - last resort: reinstall Windows

Update winget apps
 - winget upgrade --all --include-unknown

Windows Security settings may need tweaked again after insider build updates

Be sure that your signed into your Microsoft account under Settings > Accounts before running bat scripts after new insider build updates

Disable GIGABYTE update service through BIOS > Settings > IO Ports > Gigabyte Utility Downloader
